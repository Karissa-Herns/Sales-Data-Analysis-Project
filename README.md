# Sales-Data-Analysis-Project
Analysis of Sales data from two datasets.
### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from two datasets (FebSales and JanSales) for a fictional e-commerce company. By utilizing SQL queries, I extracted insights related to customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends across different locations and time periods.

### Key Features
Order Insights: Counted the number of orders with a specific 6-character order ID format and identified distinct customers placing these orders.
* Revenue Analysis: Calculated total revenue and product-wise revenue for both January and February sales.

* Product Performance: Found the top-performing products based on revenue and the most sold product categories, such as headphones.

* Location-based Sales: Analyzed sales at specific locations (e.g., Seattle, New York) to calculate order frequency and total sales revenue.

* Customer Insights: Determined the average revenue per customer and average product quantities per order for orders above two items.
Technologies Used

### Tools
SQL: For querying datasets and extracting actionable insights.
MySQL: Database management system used to store and manipulate the sales data.
Data Analysis: Analyzing sales trends, product performance, and customer purchasing behavior.

### Queries Included
Query 1: Count orders with a 6-character order ID in February.
Query 2: Find customers with orders having 6-character IDs.
Query 3: Identify the product with the lowest price in January.
Query 4: Calculate revenue per product in January.

### Results
##### This analysis provides key insights into:

* Customer buying patterns based on order length and location.
* Product performance and revenue contribution by category.
* Operational improvements by analyzing high-performing products and sales location trends.
* Future Work

### Potential future improvements to the analysis could include:

* Automating the process with stored procedures or triggers.
* Integrating data visualization using tools like Power BI or Tableau to better communicate findings.
