# Sales-Data-Analysis-Project
Analysis of Sales data from two datasets.
### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data from two datasets (FebSales and JanSales) for a fictional e-commerce company. By utilizing SQL queries, I extracted insights related to customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends across different locations and time periods.

### Key Features
Order Insights: Counted the number of orders with a specific 6-character order ID format and identified distinct customers placing these orders.
* Revenue Analysis: Calculated total revenue and product-wise revenue for both January and February sales.

* Product Performance: Found the top-performing products based on revenue and the most sold product categories, such as headphones.

* Location-based Sales: Analyzed sales at specific locations (e.g., Seattle, New York) to calculate order frequency and total sales revenue.

* Customer Insights: Determined the average revenue per customer and average product quantities per order for orders above two items.
